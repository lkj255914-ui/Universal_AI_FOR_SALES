The `userId` in the path is used for authorization. Reports are stored in `/users/{userId}/reports/{reportId}`. This path based ownership is a clear and simple way to implement security rules for the application. Since we are following path-based ownership, all the documents under `/users/{userId}` can only be accessed by the user identified by `userId`. There is no need for denormalization since all security rules can be based on `request.auth.uid`."

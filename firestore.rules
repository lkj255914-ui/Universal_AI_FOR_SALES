/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where all user-related data is private.
 * Data Structure: All data is organized hierarchically under the `/users/{userId}` path. A user's profile is stored in the root document, and their private data, such as reports, is stored in subcollections under that document (e.g., `/users/{userId}/reports/{reportId}`). This path-based structure is the primary mechanism for authorization.
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All paths are closed by default. Access must be explicitly granted.
 * - Strict Ownership: Users can only read or write data within their own document tree (`/users/{userId}/...`). Cross-user access is forbidden.
 * - No Public Data: There are no globally readable collections.
 * - No User Listing: It is not possible for any client to list all documents in the top-level `/users` collection.
 * - Self-Service Profile: A newly authenticated user is permitted to create their own user profile document, but they cannot create one for anyone else.
 * Denormalization for Authorization: Security is based on the `userId` in the document path, which must match the authenticated user's UID. For the user profile document itself, we enforce that the `id` field within the document matches the document ID in the path upon creation to ensure relational integrity.
 * Structural Segregation: The separation of user data into distinct user-owned document trees (`/users/{userId}`) provides strong security guarantees and simplifies list queries for user-specific content.
